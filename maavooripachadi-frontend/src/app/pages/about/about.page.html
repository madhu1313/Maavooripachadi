    <h1>Heritage Andhra flavours, hand-crafted for today</h1>
    <p>
      We started Maavoori Pachadi to bring the taste of amma’s kitchen back to every Telugu home.
      From sun-cured mango avakai to slow-cooked gongura mutton, every jar carries the warmth of
      our village traditions and the care of our home chefs.

      <h2>Grandma’s recipes, perfected over decades</h2>
      <p>
        Our pickles are stone-ground, sun-cured and slow-cooked exactly the way our ammamma taught us.
        We sift and clean every spice by hand, pound them in traditional rolu-batta and ferment in
        earthen jars to lock in flavour.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each batch is limited, allowing us to taste every jar, verify spice balance and ensure it
        hits your table with the same aroma that fills our kitchen in Machilipatnam.

      <h2>Sourcing mindful ingredients from local farms</h2>
      <p>
        We partner with small growers across coastal Andhra and Telangana. Our mangoes are plucked
        at dawn and transported in cold vans, our gingelly oil is cold pressed in Rajahmundry, and our
        red chilli powder is made from Guntur sannam chillies.
      </p>
      <p>
        The result? A clean label pantry—free from preservatives, artificial colours or shortcuts.
        Just sun, spice, salt and the stories we grew up with.
